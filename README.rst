Detailed documentation is available at 
http://liangfu.github.com/stereo-vision.html

The content in folders are ordered in the following rule:

* *3rd_party* - 3rd party source code 
  (currently only contains the opencv library)
* *android* - Android platform port via NDK
* *data* - image files that used for testing the project
* *doc* - documentation
* *matlab* - MATLAB implementation
* *misc* - downloaded files and some other resources
* *src* - source code repository

This project build-in with opencv-1.x, which does not mimic the MATLAB syntax.
And it can be easily ported to Android platform with the help of recent NDK 
releases.

**IMPORTANT: the code is experimental and untested, use with your own risk !!**
